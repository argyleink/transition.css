## Basics
<img src="https://github.com/argyleink/transition.css/blob/main/demo/wipe-up.gif?raw=true" />

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/transition-style">

<div transition-style="in:wipe:up">
  üëç
</div>
```

#### Installation
**NPM**  
1. `npm i transition-style` 
2. from **CSS**
```css
@import "transition-style";
```
3. or from **JS** 
```js
import 'transition-style';
```

<br>

**CDN**  
`https://unpkg.com/transition-style`  

**Individual Category Bundles**
  - Circles: `https://unpkg.com/transition-style/transition.circles.min.css`
  - Squares: `https://unpkg.com/transition-style/transition.squares.min.css`
  - Polygons: `https://unpkg.com/transition-style/transition.polygons.min.css`
  - Wipes: `https://unpkg.com/transition-style/transition.wipes.min.css`

**üëâ The Hackpack**  
`https://unpkg.com/transition-style/transition.hackpack.min.css`  

ONLY the custom properties and a couple base styles. **More options, more control, smaller import.**
Build [custom](#custom) `@keyframe` animations and MUCH more: 
- custom transitions leveraging provided variables
- multi-part transitions that aren't just `from` and `to`
- use classes (make your own BEM convention) or integrate in your CSS-in-JS architecture or front end framework

> Custom properties ship with each `.min.css` as well

### üîó Bookmarklet

Try transition.css on almost any _existing_ site! Just copy üìã the following, create a new bookmark, and paste in the URL:

```js
javascript:(function(){var a=document.createElement("link");a.rel="stylesheet";a.href="https://unpkg.com/transition-style";document.head.append(a);})();
```

You can now go to a website and click the bookmark to try it out! Animations automatically run when you manually add classes in dev tools, or run code like this in the console:

```js
$('body').setAttribute('transition-style','in:circle:bottom-right')
```

Caveat: this bookmarklet doesn't work on websites that have a strict CSP set up.

<br>

#### Usage
After `transition.css` has been added to your project, add an attribute to an element and watch the magic:  

```html
<div transition-style="in:circle:bottom-right">
  A transitioned IN element
</div>

<div transition-style="out:wipe:down">
  A transitioned OUT element
</div>
```

> if nothing is happening when using the attributes, it's likely `transition.css` has not loaded

Attributes were chosen as the default so there's no question which transition is active. **There can be only 1 at a time.** With classes, for example, what happens when multiple "transition in" classes are applied to an element? Transition.css chooses to default with a state machine approach so things like a classname collision doesn't need solved. See the [custom](#custom) section below for ways to use classes and/or the shape custom properties so transition.css can fit into your development environment. The built in attribute based approach is very easy to hack, customize and escape. 

Transition.css is very similar to [animate.css](https://animate.style). The docs they've made are excellent and show many examples of advanced usage of libraries like this. You'll notice `transition.css` is very inspired by `animate.css`.

<br><br>

## Advanced
#### Custom
Go off the rails and build your own transitions with the custom props that ship with the each bundle. There's even the `hackpack` which is exclusively the custom props ü§òüíÄ

Most of the built in transitions are from the center. Here's how you can set the `from` transition to somewhere custom. This is also the animation used on page load for [transition.style](https://transition.style).

```css
@keyframes circle-swoop {
  from {
    clip-path: var(--circle-top-right-out);
  }
  to {
    clip-path: var(--circle-bottom-right-in);
  }
}

.--in-custom {
  --transition__duration: 1s;
  --transition__easing: ease-in-out;
  animation-name: circle-swoop;
}
```

Then, in the HTML:

```html
<div transition-style class="--in-custom">
  A custom transitioned element
</div>
```

> The only rule is that you must transition from the same type of shapes

## Development
See the `svelte` branch.

## Production
`npm run bundle` concurrently bundles and minifies.
